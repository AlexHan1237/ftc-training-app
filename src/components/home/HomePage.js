The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is a robotics competition for students in grades 7â€“12 to design, build, code, and operate robots to compete in alliance-style challenges. The program aims to inspire young people to become STEM innovators and leaders. 
<br/>
In FTC, teams of up to 15 students work together with adult coaches and mentors to develop STEM skills and engineering principles. Students use a reusable platform powered by Android technology to build their robots, which can be coded using Java-based programming. Each team has two Android devices: a robot controller mounted on the robot that tells it what to do, and another device for controlling the robot.
<br/>
During competitions, teams earn points by completing tasks based on a set of game rules. The order and alliances of matches are random, and the number of matches varies based on the number of teams competing.
