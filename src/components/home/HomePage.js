                    <p className="mt-4"> <strong>The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)</strong> is a robotics competition for students
                        in grades 7â€“12 to design, build, code, and operate robots to compete in alliance-style challenges. The
                        program aims to inspire young people to become STEM innovators and leaders. </p>

                    <p className="mt-4">In FTC, teams of up to 15 students work together with adult coaches and mentors to
                        develop STEM skills and engineering principles. Students use a reusable platform powered by Android
                        technology to build their robots, which can be coded using Java-based programming. Each team has two
                        Android devices: a robot controller mounted on the robot that tells it what to do, and another device
                        for controlling the robot. </p>

                    <p className="mt-4">During competitions, teams earn points by completing tasks based on a set of game
                        rules. The order and alliances of matches are random, and the number of matches varies based on the
                        number of teams competing. </p>

                    <p className="mt-4">Starting with zero knowledge of robotics or engineering, becoming a qualified FTC team 
                        member was quite a challenge for me. I've gained a lot of insights along the way, and Iâ€™m eager to 
                        share them with anyone interested in FTC robotics. I hope this site helps make the learning process 
                        a bit easier! ðŸ™‚ </p>
