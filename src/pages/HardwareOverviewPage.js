            <h2> Hardware Overview </h2>
            Robotics involves creating intelligent machines that can operate autonomously or with minimal assistance. These 
            machines draw on concepts from computer science, engineering, and other fields. They are equipped to sense their 
            environment, make decisions, and take action. Robots can be found in various settings, including factories, 
            hospitals, farms, and even in space.<p/>

            A robot consists of several key components. The drive traing and body frame provide mobility and support, while 
            motors, commonly referred to as actuators, perform tasks. Additionally, a controller processes commands, and 
            sensors allow the robot to perceive its surroundings.<p/>
