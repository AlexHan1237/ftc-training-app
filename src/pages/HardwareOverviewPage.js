        <h2> Hardware Overview </h2>
        Robotics is about making smart machines that can do things on their own or with a bit of help. These machines are 
        built using ideas from computers, machines, and other subjects. They can sense what’s around them, decide what to 
        do, and then do it. We see robots in many places like factories, hospitals, farms, and even in space. <p/>

        A robot has different parts that help it work. First, there’s the body, which helps it move and do things. As well 
        as they also use motors usually known as actuators that make the parts move. controller for understanding commands.
        Sensors help the robot know what’s around it.<p/>
